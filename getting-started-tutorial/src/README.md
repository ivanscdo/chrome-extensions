# getting-started-tutorial

## Version History

This is a refactored version of the code you would have once you've completed the tutorial. The difference is that instead of accessing the additional color options through a menu, you have them immediately available in the popup. 

Original code found under branch [getting-started/v1.0](https://github.com/ivanscdo/chrome-extensions/tree/getting-started/v1.0)
